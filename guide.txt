1 - So for first step we need to make a venv , it help us to build our project better :
python3 -m venv .venv , for activating we use "source .venv/bin/activate" in terminal
now you can type "which pytohn3" in terminal to be sure it's activated
tip : purpose of venv is to installing specefic packages for a specefig project in this 
way we use a new version of a packages without breaking our old packages

2 - after we made it we gonna do the next step :
Open telegram and search for @BotFather, start the BotFather and click /newbot
tip : name should be something like "name" and username should be "name_bot"

3 - This is the token : "8024399259:AAH319oJAVG3YOKzeUo996gd7srLdwD-Jn8"
it's something, privet and other people "should not see it" !
how we make token privet ?
`touch .env`
`echo "token=8024399259:AAH319oJAVG3YOKzeUo996gd7srLdwD-Jn8" >> .env`
DONE!

4 - now we need to install the python-telegram-bot library ->
pip install python-telegram-bot
